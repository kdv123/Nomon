1. Download the Nomon_installer zip file
2. Unzip the file
3. Click on the installer (Nomon-0.4-amd64)
4. Choose a directory for Nomon (example: C:\Nomon) **Important:** Do not choose a directory in Program Files or Program Files (x86).
5. "Do you want to allow an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?" may appear. If it does, click "yes."

Running Nomon
============
You can also watch [this video](https://youtu.be/fv-WvW0JktE) for instructions on running and using Nomon.
1. Locate the Nomon desktop icon (it is a yellow "N")
2. Click on the icon

If you get an error "IOError: [Errno13] Permission denied" error, you have installed Nomon in the Program Files directory and will need to run Nomon as Administrator:
1. Right click on the icon
2. Select "Run as Administrator" from the list of options
3. "Do you want this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?" may appear. If it does, click "yes."

**Note:** At the moment the "talk" capabilities of Nomon are not part of the release. This will be included in a future release.

Troubleshooting
====================
**IOError: [Errno13] Permission denied**

You have Nomon installed in the Program Files directory. You can resolve this issue permanently by reinstalling Nomon in a different dirctory (such as C:\Nomon), or you can run Nomon as Administrator (see instructions on how to do this in "Running Nomon").
